Google Play,"I downloaded the Threads app with high hopes, but my experience has been quite disappointing. The app's lack of optimization is immediately noticeable – it feels sluggish and unresponsive. What's even worse is that the app crashes multiple times, making it incredibly frustrating to use. It's evident that the app contains numerous bugs and errors, which further hampers its usability. I really wanted to like Threads, but its current state leaves much to be desired. I hope the developers address th",3,27-08-2023 2:29

Google Play,"This has got to be the most annoying threads ever! No choice is given, based on the assumption you want this thread. Constantly coercing you to join threads by displaying thread numbers on your profile, deceptively making others think you are on threads! Whilst you are not! So devious! I refuse to download the app! You can't even opt out! No delete! No cancellation. There are no options. So no download!",1,16-08-2023 10:40
